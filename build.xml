<!--  This is taken from the editor ask variable named ${projectDirectory}.
    Problem here is that you can only select a FILE not a DIRECTORY. So, users
    could choose a direct child of the directory that they wish to analyze, but
    what if it's a directory just of directories? They could manually type this in,
    but I'm not sure if they would. AFAIK, there's no "directory" option
    for oXygen editor variables (see:https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/18.1/ug-author/topics/editor-variables.html) -->
